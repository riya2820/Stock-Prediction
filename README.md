# Stock Prediction
# Overview

This project aims to predict stock price movements. Uses two distinct machine learning approaches: Random Forest Classifier and a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). By leveraging historical stock data, these models attempt to forecast whether a stock's future price will rise or fall, enabling investors to make informed decisions.

# Features

Random Forest Classifier: Utilizes a combination of decision trees to predict the stock price direction based on historical data features.
RNN with LSTM: Employs a Deep Learning approach, and a feedback loop, to predict stock prices

Data Preprocessing: Includes normalization and transformation of stock price data to optimize model performance.
Performance Evaluation: Uses accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate and compare model predictions.
Requirements

# Results

Model shows promising results in predicting the direction of stock prices

The Random Forest Classifier provided a solid baseline for our predictions.
The RNN (with LSTM) model, optimized with the Adam optimizer, achieved an impressive 70% accuracy
